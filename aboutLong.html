            <p>Hello! I am JJ Bryant. To be completely candid: despite what this portfolio may...or may not...show, I have never been "cool." This nerdy '80s kid became a nerdy English teacher && now nerds out coding as a nerdy web developer (nerdCount === 4).</p>
                <p>Luckily for me, nerdy has come into its own since the '80s, and my web development work shows my different facets: nerdy, precise, chaotic, creative, logical, colorful, light, dark, and sometimes even cool, totally different than anyone would expect from this trivia-loving grandma.</p>

                <p>I'm in search of an employer who embraces all labels and is wanting to make our beautiful world an even better place. I will work hard and accurately so you can achieve your mission. Bring me aboard and let's do some awesome work together.</p>
